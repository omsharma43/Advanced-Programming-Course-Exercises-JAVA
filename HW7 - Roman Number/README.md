# question
Roman numerals were used in ancient times to write numbers and include letters such as I, X, and so on. But because mathematical calculations are difficult to do with them, today they are used only for tasks such as showing history. The program you write must read a number in String form from the input and then convert it to Roman form.
```
M
1000

D
500

C
100

L
50

X
10

V
5

I
1
```
# input
The program reads the desired number in String form and checks that all String characters are numbers from 0 to 9. If not, it prints the "ERROR" message.
# output
Print a string containing the Roman numeral corresponding to the input number.
# example:

## Sample input 1:
```
2021
```
## Sample output 1:
```
MMXXI
```
## Sample input 2:
```
5596
```
## Sample output 2:
```
MMMMMDLXXXXVI
```
