We want to penetrate the banking systems little by little, that's why we are going to approach a bank step by step, to start we need to register different customers and get the number of their accounts, to do this, please implement the following items :
1. **Implement the person registration process**

First we need to get the number of Alpha Bank customers, our input is the number of different people with accounts in this bank.
Then the registration process should be repeated to the number of people entered and customers should be saved until the end of the program.

2. **registration**

To register each person, name, surname, age, gender, nationality, telephone number, account number, number of accounts of each person and the amount of money stored in each person's account must be saved.
Tip 1: The more similar the implementation to the real world, the more complete the training score will be, and the more points will be awarded if you see a project beyond the expected level that pays more attention to detail. For example, everyone's national code is 10 digits and try to warn if it is entered incorrectly.
Tip 2: The age of the people and the number of accounts are definitely integers, but the amount of money stored in each account can be decimal.
Tip 3: The program must have a user interface and let the work be informed at each stage what inputs should be given, as well as the cleanliness of the code and the cleanliness of the names and comments are the criteria for scoring.
Tip 4: The main criterion for scoring will be the correct implementation of object-oriented and related methods such as sets, gaiters and toString (), and your correct view of the problem is expected.
Tip 5 (Compare each account created with previous accounts, and avoid adding this person if your first name, last name, and national code are the same.) Tip: Use the .equal () method.
