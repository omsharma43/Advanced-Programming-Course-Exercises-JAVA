## question
Write a program that receives a number such as N from the user and prints YES and otherwise NO if it has the property of being perfect, that is, the sum of its divisors (other than itself).
## input
You are given the number N on a line.
## output
If the number is perfect then print YES, otherwise NO.
## example:

### Sample input 1:
```
27
```
### Sample output 1:
```
NO
```
### Sample input 2:

## question
Since Lily loves mathematics and especially the geometric shape of a triangle, she wants to design a triangle of numbers for herself and she needs your help to do this. This triangle is generally a right triangle with one number in the first line, two numbers in the second line, three numbers in the third line, and so on. The numbers start with the value of one in order and from the top left of the page.

Now you write a program that, by receiving input n, prints the number of rows "as well as columns" of this triangle, and shows it in the output.
## input
The input contains only one line in which the natural number n is the number of rows in the triangle.
## output
The output of your program should be a right triangle with numbers printed at the top left of the screen with a space.
## example:

### Sample input 1:
```
4
```
### Sample output 1:
```
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
```
### Sample input 2:
```
5
```
### Sample output 2:
```
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15
```
