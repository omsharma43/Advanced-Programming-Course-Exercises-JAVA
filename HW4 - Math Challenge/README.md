# question
Since kind tees have seen the kids' interest in math challenges, they decided to ask you more and more interesting questions, you can see one of the challenges in the question below.

We are going to enter an interesting challenge with seven-digit numbers, we are going to examine whether a seven-digit number can be turned into a special number with the help of simple mathematical symbols between them or not ?!

Let's analyze the question better, suppose the number 9156747 is given as an example, the problem is simple, we want to put a mathematical operator between the digits with each combination and finally check whether the resulting number is a prime number or not.

The mathematical operators mentioned are multiplication (*), addition (+), subtraction (-), division (/).

It should be noted that all the above operations must be performed with double accuracy and at the end convert the final output to long structure data.

!!! If you have ever thought that you are facing a simple problem, you should be a little more careful with the challenge. For example, the :

Note: An important condition for this problem is to use the return method to solve it and only then you will receive a score.

# input
It is a number that you receive from the user, we guarantee that the given string consists only of numbers, but its length may not necessarily be seven and the number may consist of three digits, the program must be written in such a way that it can be used for any Input to function properly according to its different permutations. Numbers will contain zero, but it is guaranteed that it will not be 0 at the beginning.
# output
If the first number is found according to the given input, the phrase "YES" should be printed and at the bottom of it the phrase with which you reached the first number should be displayed, and if no first expression is found, the phrase "NO" will be printed.
# example:

## Sample input 1:
```
94
```
## Sample output 1:
```
YES
(9 + 4) $ 13
(9 - 4) $ 5
(9 / 4) $ 2
```
