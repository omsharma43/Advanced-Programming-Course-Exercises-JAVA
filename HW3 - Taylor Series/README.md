# question
In mathematics, the Taylor series, or Taylor expansion, is a representation of a function as an infinite set of sentences derived from the derivatives of a function at a point. In 1715, English mathematician Brooke Taylor formally introduced the concept of the Taylor series. It is customary to approximate functions around a point with a finite number of Taylor series's's.

Each finite number from the first sentence of the Taylor series is introduced into Taylor polynomials.

For the sin function around point 0 we have:
